# 🧛‍♂️ Vampiric Full Stack Challenge

Welcome, mortal developer.

You have been *chosen* to prove your worthiness to join our ancient coven of immortal programmers.

Your task: debug and enhance our centuries-old codebase that manages our vampire operations.

**AI Usage Fully Encouraged** - Even we vampires use familiar spirits and ancient AI oracles. Use whatever dark magic you would use to take care of the job in a real-world scenario.

## Awakening the Beast

Choose your backend technology; both provide identical challenge.

⚠️ **Stick to `npm` and the latest stable version of Node!**

### React Frontend & Node Backend (preferred)

From root, execute:

```bash
npm run setup
npm start
```

### React Frontend & Python Backend

From root, execute:

```bash
npm run setup:python
npm run start:python
```

## 🕷️ Objective 1: Pest Control

Our ancient codebase has been infected by mortal incompetence.

- **B-1**: Edit Vampire Profile's age validation works... weirdly
- **B-2**: Edit Vampire Profile's updates aren't reflected properly
- **B-3**: Blood Sack's "Recruit for Coven" straight up doesn't work

## 🎯 Objective 2: Choose Your Immortal Challenge

After exterminating the bugs above, select **ONE** of these features to implement:

### F-1: 📸 Profile Picture Upload

Vampires deserve to update their eternal visage.

**Requirements:**
- Vampires can upload pictures through the site
- Uploaded pictures appear in vampire profiles
- Pictures outlast browsing sessions
- **Bonus:** Remind us not to take mirror selfies (they'd be empty anyway!)

### F-2: ⚡ Real-Time Blood Sack Status Updates

Vampires need to track blood sacks in real time to trust our site (surely this scales perfectly, right?).

**Requirements:**
- Changes appear instantly in the other instance with no refresh needed when following these steps:
    1. Open two browser instances or tabs side-by-side
    2. Update a blood sack's status in one instance
