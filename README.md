# 🧛‍♂️ Vampiric Full Stack Challenge

Welcome, mortal developer, to the Eternal Night Coding Challenge.

You have been *chosen* to prove your worthiness to join our ancient coven of immortal programmers.

Your task: debug and enhance our centuries-old codebase that manages our vampire operations.

**Full AI Usage Encouraged** - Even we vampires use familiar spirits and ancient AI oracles. Use whatever dark magic you would use to take care of the job in a real-world scenario.

## Awakening the Beast

Choose your backend technology; both provide identical challenge.

⚠️ **Stick to `npm` and the latest stable version of Node!**

### Node.js Backend (preferred)

```bash
npm run setup
npm start
```

### Python Backend

```bash
npm run setup:python
npm run start:python
```

## 🕷️ Primary Objective: Pest Control

Our ancient codebase has been infected by mortal incompetence.

- **B-1**: Our site relies on backend for "vampire profile" data sanitization
- **B-2**: "Vampire profile" updates aren't reflected properly
- **B-3**: Blood sack "Recruit for Coven" button doesn't work
