# 🧛‍♂️ Vampiric Full Stack Challenge

## Purpose

Welcome, mortal developer, to the Eternal Night Coding Challenge. You have been *chosen* to prove your worthiness to join our ancient coven of immortal programmers. Your task: debug and enhance our centuries-old codebase that manages our vampire operations.

**AI Usage Encouraged** - Even we vampires use familiar spirits and ancient AI oracles. Use whatever dark magic you need.

## Awakening the Beast

Choose your backend technology:

### Node.js Backend (default)
```bash
npm run setup
npm start
```

### Python Backend
```bash
npm run setup:python
npm run start:python
```

Enter our digital lair at: http://localhost:3000

*Note: Both backends provide identical functionality and bugs. Choose your preferred stack freely.*

## 🕷️ Primary Objective: Pest Control (Bug Hunt)
*Our ancient codebase has been infected by mortal incompetence. Fix ALL of these issues:*

### Critical Bugs (Fix All)
- **B-1**: Site relies on backend for "vampire profile" data sanitization
- **B-2**: Vampire profile updates aren't reflected properly
- **B-3**: Blood sack "Recruit for Coven" button doesn't work

## 🎯 Secondary Objectives: Feature Enhancements 
*Choose features that match your skills and desired challenge level*
